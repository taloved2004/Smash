# Smash - Small Shell
A school project for implementing a Linux shell!

Hello!
This is a school project for creating a small instance of Linux bash shell.
In here we have created our own implementions for Bash command as the following list:
1.  "chprompt"
2.  "showpid"
3.  "pwd"
4.  "cd" 
5.  "jobs"
6.  "fg"
7.  "bg"
8.  kill"
9.  "quit" / "quit kill" - (exiting the shell program)
10. "setcore"
11. "getfiletype"
12. "chmod"
13. "timeout"

We also have:
1.  Piping support       (" ls | grep a ")
2.  I/O Redirection support  (" echo "hello" > a.txt ")
3.  External Command support - for every other Bash command, just enter the command

For better understanding on how to use commands or the instructions we were given, you can look into the "hw-instructions.pdf"

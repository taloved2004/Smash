#Smash - Small Shell
A school project for implementing a Linux shell!

Hello!
This is a school project for creating a small instance of the Linux bash shell.
In our project, we have created our own implementations for several Bash commands, as follows:
1.  "chprompt"
2.  "showpid"
3.  "pwd"
4.  "cd" 
5.  "jobs"
6.  "fg"
7.  "bg"
8.  kill"
9.  "quit" or "quit kill" - exiting the shell program (with kill option, kills all commands) 
10. "setcore"
11. "getfiletype"
12. "chmod"
13. "timeout"

We also have:
1.  Piping support (" ls | grep a ")
2.  I/O Redirection support (" echo "hello" > a.txt ")
3.  External Command support For every other Bash command, just enter the command.

For a better understanding of how to use commands or the instructions we were given, you can look into "hw-instructions.pdf."

Instructions for executing the smash:
1. Execute "chmod +x ./compile".
2. Execute "./compile".
3. Execute "./smash".
4. Enjoy the smash!
